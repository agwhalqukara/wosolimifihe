The spaghetti squash, which is orange and watermelon-shaped, is a variation of the butternut squash. When cooked, the meat breaks into spaghetti-like strands, much like its relative. This is why it was given this name. Orangetti Squash, in contrast to summer squash (which is selected while it is young and the skin is delicate), has a hard, thick skin, and only the flesh is consumed.
When it comes to this, is spaghetti squash the same thing as orangetti squash?</description></item><item><title>At $45 Million, This Huge Chicago Mansion Is The City's Most Expensive Listing</title><link>/at-45-million-this-huge-chicago-mansion-is-the-city-s-most-expensive-listing.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/at-45-million-this-huge-chicago-mansion-is-the-city-s-most-expensive-listing.html</guid><description>If you're looking for a place to live in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago, you need at least six bedrooms, eleven bathrooms, and 25,000 square feet, and you've got $45 million to burn, there's a mansion on Burling Street that fits the bill ‚Äì and that Curbed recently reported is the priciest listing in the entire city.
